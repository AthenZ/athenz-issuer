# athenz-issuer

athenz-issuer is the out-of-tree implementation of the cert-manager issuer for Athenz. It acts as a bridge between Athenz and cert-manager, allowing you to use Athenz as a certificate authority for your Kubernetes cluster while using cert-manager to manage the lifecycle of the certificates.
